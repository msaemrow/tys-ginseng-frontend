                At Ty's Ginseng, we're proud to be a small, family-owned
                business, where every customer has the opportunity to interact
                directly with the owner. My family and I grow ginseng in
                southern Minnesota and our Minnesota weather creates the perfect
                conditions for ginseng to grow in our woods. We take great pride
                in our roots to make sure that you get only the best quality
                woods grown ginseng.
              </p>
              <p className="lead">
                I founded my ginseng business in 2012, building on the knowledge
                and skills I acquired from my grandpa, who has over 50 years of
                expertise in woods grown ginseng. With a strong emphasis on
                producing high-quality roots, I am dedicated to upholding my
                grandfather's legacy of excellence in ginseng farming.
