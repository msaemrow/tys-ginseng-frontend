        <p className="mb-0">
          Since we grow wild simulated ginseng, we have to prepare the woods for
          planting whih includes clearing fallen trees, sticks and weeds from
          the areas the ginseng seeds will be planted. We aim to not disturb
          areas of the woods where ginseng is not being planted{" "}

        <p className="mb-0  mt-3">Step 2: Make Ginseng Beds</p>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">
          To give the ginseng plants the best chance of succeeding, we hand dig
          ginseng beds that have trenches on either side to facilitate proper
          drainage. An average ginseng bed is between 250 and 300 feet long and
          an average woods will hold hold anywhere from 50-100 beds

        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">Step 3: Plant Seeds</p>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">
          Seeds are planted in the beds using a push behind one row planter to
          ensure even spacing, proper seed depth within the soil and proper row
          spacing.{" "}

      <div>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">Step 4: Monitor and Maintain</p>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">
          After the seeds are planted, the plants will grow 6+ years to achieve
          full maturity. During this time, maintainence is done to the beds
          which includes cleaning up fallen trees and branches, making sure weed
          growth doesn't over take the ginseng plants, and making sure the beds
          are draining excess moisture properly.{" "}

        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">Step 5: Harvest</p>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">
          Once the ginseng roots are ready to harvest, the roots are hand dug
          one by one. This is to ensure roots are not damaged during the digging
          process and to ensure our larger roots are not accidentally cut in
          half while digging. After digging the roots, they will be washed,
          dried, made into a product and sent to our customers.{" "}
