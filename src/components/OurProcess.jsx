        <p className="mb-0">
          Since we grow wild simulated ginseng, we have to prepare the woods
          which includes clearing fallen trees and sticks from the areas where
          the ginseng seeds will be planted.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p className="mb-0  mt-3">Step 2: Make Ginseng Beds</p>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">
          To give the ginseng plants the best chance of succeeding, we hand dig
          ginseng beds that have trenches on either side to facilitate proper
          drainage.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">Step 3: Plant Seeds</p>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">
          Seeds are planted in the beds using a push behind one row planter to
          ensure even spacing, proper seed depth within the soil, and proper row
          spacing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">Step 4: Monitor and Maintain</p>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">
          After the seeds are planted, we allow them to grow a minimum of 6
          years before harvesting. During these years, maintenance is done by
          cleaning up fallen trees and branches.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">Step 5: Harvest</p>
        <p className="mb-0 mt-3">
          Once the ginseng roots have reached 6+ years, the roots are hand dug
          one by one. This is to ensure roots are not damaged during the digging
          process. After digging the roots, they are washed, dried, and made
          into a powder for our customers to enjoy.
